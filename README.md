# Bouncing-DVD-Game

Extremely rudimentary proof-of-concept for a multiplayer game, where players can put down text (or some other image) and pray to be the last one standing. Players get eliminated as the DVD logo passes over their text or image.

heatmap.py aims to figure out the mathematics of the game in order to create new "gamemodes" and make the game more fair.
